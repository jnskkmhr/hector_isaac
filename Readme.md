Modified from https://github.com/DRCL-USC/Hector_Simulation

## HECTOR: Humanoid for Enhanced ConTrol and Open-source Research

This branch is under development of the ROS+Isaac simulation for the Hector humanoid robot. \
For humanoid ROS model with arms use the ROS_Humanoid_Simulation branch.

## Dependencies:
* [Boost](http://www.boost.org) (version 1.5.4 or higher)
* [CMake](http://www.cmake.org) (version 2.8.3 or higher)
* [LCM](https://lcm-proj.github.io) (version 1.4.0 or higher)
* [ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/) Neotic
* [Gazebo](https://gazebosim.org/home) 11
* [Eigen3](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) (>3.3)
* unitree_legged_sdk 
* [qpOASES](https://github.com/coin-or/qpOASES)
* ROS_Packages

Install dependencies via apt
```
sudo apt-get install -y liblcm-dev
```

## System Requirements:
* x86 platform with nvidia GPU
* Ubuntu20.04 with ROS1 noetic installed

## Build:
```bash
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin build
```

### launch and run simulation:
1. Run Isaac
```bash
~/local/.share/ov/pkg/isaac_2023.1.1/python.sh hector_ros1_env.py
```

2. Run hector_controller
```bash
roslaunch hector_control hector_control.launch
```

* Click the start button at the bottom of the simulator, the robot should stand up/move away
* In some occasions the controller does not kick in after starting, please terminate the controller with ctrl + \\. Then go back to the simulator, pause, and reset (ctrl + R). Rerun controller. 

## Keyboard Control: 
* Inside the terminal window, use W or S to control x direction speed
* Use A or D to control robot turning 
* Use J or L to control y direction speed
