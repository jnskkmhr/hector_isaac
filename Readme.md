# Hector Simulation Software in ROS+IsaacSim

## HECTOR: Humanoid for Enhanced ConTrol and Open-source Research

This branch is under development of the ROS+Isaac simulation for the Hector humanoid robot. \
For humanoid ROS model with arms use the ROS_Humanoid_Simulation branch.

Install dependencies via apt
```
sudo apt-get install -y liblcm-dev ros-noetic-controller-manager ros-noetic-ros-control ros-noetic-ros-controllers ros-noetic-joint-state-controller ros-noetic-effort-controllers ros-noetic-velocity-controllers ros-noetic-position-controllers ros-noetic-robot-controllers ros-noetic-robot-state-publisher ros-noetic-gazebo-ros-pkgs ros-noetic-gazebo-ros-control
```

## System Requirements:
* x86 platform with nvidia GPU
* Ubuntu20.04 with ROS1 noetic installed

## Build:
```bash
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin build
```

### launch and run simulation:
1. Run Isaac

2. Run ros controller manager
```bash
roslaunch unitree_gazebo biped_isaac.launch
```
The robot should be standing on the ground

3. Run hector_controller
```bash
roslaunch hector_control hector_control.launch
```

* Click the start button at the bottom of the simulator, the robot should stand up/move away
* In some occasions the controller does not kick in after starting, please terminate the controller with ctrl + \\. Then go back to the simulator, pause, and reset (ctrl + R). Rerun controller. 

## Keyboard Control: 
* Inside the terminal window, use W or S to control x direction speed
* Use A or D to control robot turning 
* Use J or L to control y direction speed
